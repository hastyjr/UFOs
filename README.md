# UFOs

## Overview of Project
Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Dana's goal is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings.
So, she essentially needs to build two things: the webpage that will allow users to view the data (HTML) and a dynamic table that will present it (JavaScript).

Dana wants to storyboard her website to have an idea of what her readers will see when they view the final 
product. 

Storyboarding is incredibly useful in determining the layout of a webpage, so it's important to complete this step early in order to save time later. It's like building a house. You need to know how it's all going to fit together before you start building!

Once the template has been created, Dana can begin to code the JavaScript portion by first importing the data and then referencing it with a variable.

## Overview of Project



## Results
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria.

* Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.



## Summary
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
