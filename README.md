# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to assist Dana in meeting her goal to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. 

### __Requirements__
She essentially needs to build two things: the webpage that will allow users to view the data `(HTML)` and a dynamic table that will present it `(JavaScript)`.

### __Wants__
Dana wants to storyboard her website to have an idea of what her readers will see when they view the final 
product. 

Storyboarding is incredibly useful in determining the layout of a webpage, so it's important to complete this step early in order to save time later. It's like building a house. You need to know how it's all going to fit together before you start building!



## Results
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria.



* Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.



## Summary
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

One of the drawbacks of this new design is how the filter on the website is not completely accurtate. While it does filter on some attributes, it does not filter out entries that do not apply to the filter. 

Two recommendations for further development would be to implement some dynamic code that will appropriatley filter content on specific attributes within the text boxes. Another recommendation is to implmenet better user experience by providing a drop-downs for options that are available. One example is providing a dropbown for `city`, `country` and `shape`. This would allow a user to easily identify if the city they are looking or is part of this database.
